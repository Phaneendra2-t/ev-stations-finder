## üó∫Ô∏è Features & Functionality

### Q: How does the app find my location?
**A:** The app uses the browser's Geolocation API. You'll be prompted to allow location access on first use. If denied, you can manually update your location in Settings.

### Q: Why are some stations showing as "Unknown" status?
**A:** Not all charging stations report real-time availability. The status depends on:
- Station operator's API integration
- Last update timestamp
- Network connectivity

### Q: Can I use this app without internet?
**A:** Yes! After the first load:
- The app caches station data
- Map tiles are stored locally
- Favorites work offline
- You'll see an offline banner when disconnected

### Q: How accurate is the distance calculation?
**A:** Distances are calculated using the Haversine formula (straight-line distance). Actual driving distance may vary. Tap "Navigate" for accurate route distance via Google Maps.

### Q: What's the difference between Level 2 and DC Fast charging?
**A:**
- **Level 2**: 7-19 kW, 4-8 hours for full charge (home/workplace)
- **DC Fast**: 50-350 kW, 20-60 minutes for 80% charge (highway/public)

## üîß Technical Questions

### Q: What browsers are supported?
**A:** 
- **Desktop**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Mobile**: iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Mobile, Samsung Internet

### Q: Why isn't the PWA installing on my device?

## üé® Customization

### Q: How do I change the app colors?
**A:** Edit `tailwind.config.js`:
```javascript
colors: {
  primary: {
    500: '#10b981', // Change this to your color
  }
}
```

### Q: Can I add more languages?

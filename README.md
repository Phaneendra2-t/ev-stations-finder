## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm/yarn

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-of-devil
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create icon assets**
   
   Create a `/public/icons` directory and add PNG icons in the following sizes:
   - 72x72, 96x96, 128x128, 144x144, 152x152, 192x192, 384x384, 512x512
   
   You can use a tool like [PWA Asset Generator](https://github.com/onderceylan/pwa-asset-generator) or create them manually.

4. **Configure API (Optional)**
   
   The app works with OpenChargeMap's public API without a key, but for higher rate limits:
   - Get a free API key from [OpenChargeMap](https://openchargemap.org/site/develop/api)
   - Update `src/utils/api.js`:
     ```javascript
     const API_KEY = 'your-api-key-here';
     ```

5. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The app will open at `http://localhost:3000`

6. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   
   The optimized build will be in the `/dist` directory.

7. **Preview production build**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

## üéØ Usage

### First Launch
1. Grant location permission when prompted
2. The app will automatically load nearby charging stations
3. Explore stations on the map or switch to list view

### Finding Stations
- **Map View**: See stations as pins with color-coded availability
  - Green: Available
  - Red: Occupied
  - Gray: Unknown status
- **List View**: Browse stations sorted by distance, name, or availability
- **Filters**: Use the filter panel to narrow results by charger type and distance

### Navigation
1. Select a station from the map or list
2. Tap "Navigate" to open Google Maps with directions
3. Share station location via the share button

### Offline Mode
- The app automatically caches station data and map tiles
- When offline, you'll see a banner with cached data
- Favorites are always available offline

### Installing as PWA
- **iOS**: Tap Share ‚Üí Add to Home Screen
- **Android**: Tap menu ‚Üí Install App
- **Desktop**: Look for install prompt in address bar

## üîß Configuration

### Customizing Filters
Edit `src/context/AppContext.jsx` to change default filter values:
```javascript
const [filters, setFilters] = useState({
  showLevel2: true,
  showDCFast: true,
  showAvailable: true,
  showOccupied: true,
  showUnknown: true,
  maxDistance: 25, // km
});
```

### Adjusting Cache Duration
Modify cache expiration in `vite.config.js`:
```javascript
expiration: {
  maxEntries: 100,
  maxAgeSeconds: 60 * 30 // 30 minutes
}
```

## üí° Tips

1. **Better Performance**: Enable "Reduce Motion" in accessibility settings if animations lag
2. **Data Usage**: Use offline mode in areas with poor connectivity
3. **Battery Saving**: Disable auto-refresh in settings when not needed
4. **Accuracy**: Ensure location services are enabled for best results
